# Among Us Wireshark Dissector

Interacting with wireshark is painful. It takes more work than it's worth when all I wanted was a quick way to analyze unknown packets.

Abandoning in favour of `dump-transformer`.

This is the only example of a full rust dissector I know of though, so not all bad. Just don't read the code
